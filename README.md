HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
--------------------

Use the arrow keys to pilot the taxi. Pick up a passenger and get to the
destination in one piece to make money. The faster the delivery, the higher
the pay.

With each delivery the city on the Moon grows. This makes navigation harder,
but soon shops will also open and start selling useful items. Just fly over
the blue surface and wait a few seconds to make the deal.

  - Buy Shields:     Each shield will save you from one otherwise lethal
                     collision.
  - Buy Bombs:       Launch the bomb with the Space key to clear your path.
  - Upgrade Engine:  Makes you faster.
  - Pay Debt:        Reduces your debt. You start the game with $1000 in debt.
                     Try to reduce your debt to zero.
